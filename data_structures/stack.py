"""
    Stack: A stack is a basic data structure that can be logically thought as
    linear structure represented by a real physical stack or pile, a structure
    where insertion and deletion of items takes place at one end called top of
    the stack. The basic concept can be illustrated by thinking of your data set
    as a stack of plates or books where you can only take the top item off the
    stack in order to remove things from it. This structure is used all
    throughout programming.
